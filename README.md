# FOSS-Nutrition-Calculator
This is a simple app for Linux to calculate the nutrional value of combined ingredients. This is meant to help people understand the nutrional value of the foods they cook. 

For now it only has a limited list of vegetables but I will be adding more food types in the future. 
It's a CLI program for now. I am working on a GTK version as well. 

Please note: I have zero skills in writing code (I am too old and too many learning diablities to code).I made this using AI.
